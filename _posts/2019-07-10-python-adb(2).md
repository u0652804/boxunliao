description:  Use Python to execute adb commands(2)
---
Use Python to execute adb commands for controling mobile like smart phone and tablet.

### Idea
Execute adb by Python must let there in same directory.
kinds
1. Put Python file in adb tool directory before execute.
2. When executing Python file, change execute directory to adb tool directory.(Use case)
3. Setted adb tool in Environment Variable before coding.

### Install
[Python link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[adb link](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools "adb link")
[pycharm(python IDE) link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

### Command
adb command to get list of connected devices:
```shell
adb devices
```
### Start developing
1. New Python package and Python file(adb_test_k2.py) and put adb tool into this project.

2. edit Python file
adb_test_k2.py

```python
import os

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # record this execute dir.
    original_path = os.getcwd()
    print("project dir :",  original_path)

    # get and change to directory of adb tool inside this project
    parent_path = os.path.abspath("..")
    adb_dir = os.path.join(parent_path, 'platform-tools')
    os.chdir(adb_dir)

    # execute adb cmd
    adb = 'adb devices'
    os.system(adb)

    os.system("pause")


```
### Demo result
double click .py to execute python
